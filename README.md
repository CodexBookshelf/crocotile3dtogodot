### A 3.4 build that enables Crocotile 3d controls in Godot:

https://github.com/prominentdetail/godot/commits/3.4

- If "Emulate 3 Button Mouse" is enabled in the settings (Editor > Editors > 3d > Navigation), it will use the default crocotile bindings to Rotate/Pan/Zoom the 3d scenes.

  - Spacebar+LMB = Rotate
  - Spacebar+MMB = Zoom (or scrollwheel)
  - Spacebar+RMB = Pan.
